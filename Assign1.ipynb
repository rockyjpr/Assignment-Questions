    "Ans 1 -  An exception in Python refers to an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. Exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or programming errors. Here's a breakdown of the differences between exceptions and errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exceptions**\n",
    "  - Occur during runtime.\n",
    "  - Can be caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "  - Examples include ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, and FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Errors**:\n",
    "  - Can be syntax errors or runtime errors.\n",
    "  - Syntax errors occur during parsing of code and prevent the program from running.\n",
    "  - Runtime errors occur during program execution but cannot be handled by try-except blocks.\n",
    "  - Examples include NameError, TypeError, and IndentationError.\n",

    "It seems like you're asking about the use of the try, else, and finally blocks together in Python, along with the concept of raising exceptions. Let's break down each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "try block: This is where you place the code that you expect might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, Python looks for an appropriate exception handler (an except block) to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "else block: The else block is executed if the code in the try block executes successfully without raising any exceptions. It's typically used for code that should only run if no exceptions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "finally block: The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's typically used for cleanup tasks that must be performed, such as closing files or releasing resources. This block ensures that resources are always properly released, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "raising exceptions: In Python, you can manually raise exceptions using the raise statement. This is often done when certain conditions are met and you want to explicitly signal an error or exceptional condition in your code.\n",
