    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved in Python through classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class (subclass) can inherit properties and behavior from another class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics. Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of their superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, even when they are actually instances of a subclass. It enables a single interface to be used for objects of different types and provides a way to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading."
